  * optimize code, make debootstrap faster (Closes: #871835)
    - use hash instead of grep for each line we read
    - we can use elsif, because the line can't match both patterns
    - There's no need to print the dependencies for each package separately,
      if when later do sort|uniq, so just collect all dependencies in a hash
      and print them at the end
    - do not read all lines of the Packages file into the perl scripts,
      egrep is used for filtering only the lines we need to read, since egrep
      is faster than perl, this save a lot of time
    - speed up by using grep -P and setting LC_ALL=C
    - automatic detect if grep support perl regex
    - in this part, we only need the package name and priority this makes
      another little speedup, since the perl part need less lines to parse
