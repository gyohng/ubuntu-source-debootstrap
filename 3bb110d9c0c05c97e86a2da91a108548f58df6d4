  * debian/tests/control: run debootstrap with unshared namespaces
  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * d/tests/debian-testing:
    - More accurately emulate the behaviour of pbuilder 0.231
    - Revert fake/schroot-1.6.10-3 to an accurate emulation of the
      behaviour of schroot 1.6.10-3 (Closes: #983311)
    - Document schroot 1.6.10-3 with the default profile as expected to
      fail to use /dev/pts in a lxc >= 3 or Docker container; this is a
      schroot bug (#983423) and not a debootstrap bug
    - Resync fake/schroot-proposed with the patch proposed on #983423
    - Improve debug logging
    - Expand doc-comments
    - With these changes, the autopkgtest is confirmed to pass in
      autopkgtest-virt-qemu (Closes: #983197)
    - Skip systemd-nspawn phase when $container is set
