  * [hoary] Add libsasl2-modules. Add lib64gcc1, libc6-sparc64, and strace

    debootstrap (0.2.45-0.2) unstable; urgency=low
      * Non-maintainer upload.
      * [sarge, sid] Replace libparted1.6-0 with libparted1.6-12 for ia64,
        to keep up with the ABI changes for that package. (Closes: #295571)
      * [sarge, sid] include pciutils on hppa as well, per request of the
        hppa folks. (Closes: #283752)

    experimental so devices.tar.gz isn't empty on ia64...  oops... /o\
  * NMU to resolve d-i inability to install sid on ia64
  * add pciutils to the base package list for ia64, to avoid having to regress
    efibootmgr in unstable, closes: #270315, #268490
  * [sarge] Removed "gcc-3.0-base" and "libstdc++3" for HPPA as they have been
    removed from sarge as well on that arch. (Closes: #268917)
  * [sarge] Added back libgnutls10 in order not to break d-i testing.
    (Closes: #268578, #268663).
  * Acknowledge NMUs. (Closes: #262137, #262165, #262178, #262375)
  * [sarge] Switch to libgnutls11 so exim4 can switch. (Closes: #268325) 
  * [sid] Removed "gcc-3.0-base" and "libstdc++3" for HPPA as they have been

    for "file" URL documentation and a more complete example. (Closes: #226662)
  * Non-maintainer upload
  * [sarge, sid] Add missing libgcrypt11 to base, needed by libgnutls11
    in sid and needed in sarge for opencdk8 to be rebuilt against it
    (closes: #262375, #262178).
  * Non-maintainer upload with consent of JHM.
  * Pull libfribidi0 back out of base, it's opportunistically installed
    by d-i now for the locales that need it (closes: #262137).
  * Re-add bootloaders on ia64, sparc, mips, hppa, and m68k to base,
    because debian-installer isn't ready for this change (closes: #262165).
  * High urgency upload as per tbm's request.
  * [sarge, sid] No longer install setserial, as it causes problems on some
    systems (e.g. #212646) and there is a consensus it is no longer needed in
    a base environment.
  * [sarge, sid] Removed aboot, aboot-base, elilo, efibootmgr, silo, dvhtool,
    delo, palo, vmelilo. As per the consensus reached in the thread starting

    installation of boot loaders is now debian-installer's responsibility.

    right to left languages possible. (Closes: #253229)

  * [sid] Added libgnutls11 as libgnutls10 is being phased out.

  * Acknowledge NMUs. (Closes: #258350, #260253)
  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * [sarge, sid] Drop quik from powerpc, as debian-installer handles this
    now (closes: #260253).
  * NMU
  * add passwd to sid.buildd,sarge.buildd as bash depends on them
