  * Revert the addition of (mandatory) security support as debootstrap's
    goal is to provide with a basic Debian system that many provisioning
    systems are built upon. Changing behaviour now seems to be doing a
    disservice to all those tools that would need adapting. In addition to
    not seeming to be a good idea, that triggers regressions for a number
    of use cases (Closes: #953759, #953588, #953593, #953594, #953617).
