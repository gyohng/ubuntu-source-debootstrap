  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Split setup_devices in setup_devices (which now only deals with static
    device nodes) and setup_dynamic_devices, and move the calls to
    setup_devices from the beginning of the second stage to the end of the
    first stage.
    setup_dynamic_devices mounts the appropriate filesystems which provide
    dynamic device nodes for the architectures which need one in
    debootstrap (kfreebsd and hurd).
    This fixes a bug in --second-stage introduced in 1.0.34 and exposed
    by the devices-related changes of 1.0.76: the second stage debootstrap
    runs "dpkg --print-architecture >/dev/null" at the very beginning of
    the program when /dev is still empty, so it creates an empty regular
    file in place of /dev/null and this will cause mknod to fail later.
