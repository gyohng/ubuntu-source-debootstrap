  * When removing $TARGET/debootstrap, debootstrap.log is still open as
    stdout/stderr and needs to remain so, but after unlinking it some NFS
    servers implement this by a temporary file in the same directory, which
    makes it impossible to rmdir that directory. Moving it instead works
    around the problem (thanks, Steven McCoy; closes: Malone #65003).
