  * Recommend debian-archive-keyring, and if it is installed,
    default to checking gpg signatures of the Release file against it
    when bootstrapping sid, squeeze, wheezy, etch, and lenny.
    Closes: #560038
  * Add --no-check-gpg option that can be used to disable release file
    verification. Closes: #624229
  * Needs base-installer 1.117.
  * Add a warning message if the keyring file is not available, and
    --no-check-gpg is not specified.
  * Clear all global variables used for options, so that unclean
    environment doesn't break debootstrap. Closes: #621657
  * Removed the --boot-floppies switch and mode. Assuming this has
    not been used in 10 years.
