  * Improve code to choose between libc packages. Thanks to Luca Favatella
    <slackydeb@gmail.com> for first version of the patch.

  * Remove partial support for emitting translated progress messages with
    gettext. Don't panic; d-i still has all the support necessary for this.
    debootstrap's own support for doing this outside d-i with gettext's
    shell bindings has been completely broken ever since it was added in
    2003, though, and nobody has complained. Fixing it would require a big
    pile of infrastructure and some non-trivial patches, plus arranging to
    copy all the translations over from base-installer, and it just doesn't
    seem worth it, so lose the cruft (LP: #188690).
  * Export PATH, just to make sure. It isn't necessarily exported by shells
    running from init=/bin/sh or similar, and the upstream bash maintainer
    is unwilling to export it by default; it's easy enough to do so here
    (LP: #320188).
