  * Make sure to deduplicate package list in download_release to avoid
    issues while counting downloaded packages. The failure path could lead
    to printing some strange integer (Closes: #709751, #768445, #785276,
    #774752).
    This was reported to mostly happen whenever --no-resolve-deps is used.
  * Add support for --force-check-gpg so that one can programmatically
    make sure keyring checks are used and that no fallback to an https
    mirror happens (Closes: #661501, #733179, #775454).
  * Switch default mirror from ftp.us.debian.org to the new, official
    http redirector service: httpredir.debian.org
  * Make it possible to override the MAKEDEV variable (Closes: #734743).
    Thanks, Wookey!
