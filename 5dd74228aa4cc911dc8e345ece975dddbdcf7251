  * Cope with pre-dependencies of included packages that aren't in Priority:
    required (closes: #487908).
  * Upgrade to debhelper v7. (Override rules get pretty hairy for this
    package, so I haven't switched to dh(1).)
  * Use ports.ubuntu.com as default mirror on sparc for Ubuntu hardy and
    beyond (LP: #431145).
  * Add (Ubuntu) lucid as a symlink to gutsy.
  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Makefile: remove unused ARCH variable.
