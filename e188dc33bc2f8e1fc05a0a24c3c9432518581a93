  * Improve wording for --log-extra-deps in the manpage, thanks to
    intrigeri for the report.
  [ Hideki Yamane ]
  * Use $container to detect systemd-nspawn and lxc{-libvirt} (Closes: #902350)
  * cache-dir option: change error detection order
  * Rervert "Add 2nd exclude package check to really exclude packages even if
    it breaks dependencies" since it doesn't work as expected and cause
    regression (Closes: #901977) and (Reopen: #830794, #557322, #783589)
    To make it proper, just remove "--exclude" packages twice but do not
    exec dependencies resolution in 2nd time, I guess.
