  * Restore the old symlinks removed in the previous SRU.  While not
    needed by debootstrap itself, other tools may call debootstrap with
    the optional 'script' argument (which was always unnecessary when
    its value was the same as the 'suite' argument), and this change
    broke compatibility with them.  LP: #2024483.
