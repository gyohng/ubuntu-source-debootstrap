  * Policy version 3.9.5: no changes required.
  * Install apt-transport-https if installing from an HTTPS mirror
    (LP: #1135163).  It may still be necessary to copy certificates into
    place, but there's at least a reasonable chance that somebody installing
    from HTTPS may want to keep using it, and we have to install
    apt-transport-https at this point otherwise they won't be able to do
    that end-to-end.
