  * Fix for ar usage, thanks to Guillem Jover. Closes: #598729
  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Remove 5 second sleeps when debootstrap finds additional required
    dependencies. d-i just got that much faster.
  * Use SHA checksums. Defaulting to SHA256, and configurable by 
    SHA_SIZE environment variable. Closes: #614315
  * If a sha256sum program is not available, fall back to sha1sum.
    This is to support debootstrap use on embedded systems, which are more
    likely to have the latter.
  * Avoid new(?) warning from dpkg about missing Maintainer field when
    feigning install of a package.
