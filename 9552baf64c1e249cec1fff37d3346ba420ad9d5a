  * Non-maintainer upload targeting Debian 12.2, with maintainer approval
    from Luca Boccassi.
  * Backport merged-/usr support changes from trixie:
    - Implement merged-/usr by post-merging.
      This changes the bootstrap order so that it will be possible for a
      future version of base-files in trixie/sid to take responsibility for
      creating the /bin, /sbin, /lib* symlinks, and is a prerequisite for
      lifting the moratorium imposed by #1035831.
      (Closes: #1049898; implementation by Helmut Grohne)
    - functions: Reinstate setup_merged_usr() as it existed before
      fixing #1049898, for backwards-compatibility with older versions of
      mmdebstrap.
    - functions: Default to merged-/usr for suites newer than bookworm,
      even for the buildd profile. This allows packages targeting trixie
      to assume that merged-/usr is the only layout possible, and is a
      prerequisite for lifting the moratorium imposed by #1035831.
    - Mention --merged-usr in --help output. (Closes: #1031828)
  * Backport autopkgtest regression fixes from trixie:
    - Revert fake/schroot-1.6.10-3 to an accurate emulation of the
      behaviour of schroot 1.6.10-3 (Closes: #983311)
    - Document schroot 1.6.10-3 with the default profile as expected to
      fail to use /dev/pts in a lxc >= 3 or Docker container; this is a
      schroot bug (#983423) and not a debootstrap bug
    - With these changes, the autopkgtest is confirmed to pass in
      autopkgtest-virt-qemu (Closes: #983197)
