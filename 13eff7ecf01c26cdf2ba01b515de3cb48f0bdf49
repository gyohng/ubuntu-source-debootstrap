  * Allow the suite to be stable, testing, or unstable when debootstrapping
    Debian. Closes: #288109
  * Make scripts directory in source tree look like installed directory,
    and add a section to README explaining an easy way to run
    debootstrap w/o installing it. Closes: #345762
  * Convert rules file to use dh with overrides.
  * Remove binary-basedebs target from debian/rules.
    This target has been broken in multiple ways since 2007. While I
    accidentially partially fixed it with the above changes, this is evidence
    it's dead code that can be safely removed.
