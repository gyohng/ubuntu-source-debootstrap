  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Instead of creating a /dev/ptmx → pts/ptmx symlink unconditionally,
    try mknod with “c 5 2” parameters first, and fall back to a symlink
    only if it fails. This should help with various tools like pbuilder,
    sbuild, and schroot (Closes: #817236).
  * Add autopkgtest support to test various scenarios.
  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Uniformize COMPONENTS/USE_COMPONENTS handling.
