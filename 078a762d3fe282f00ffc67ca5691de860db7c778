  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Add dapper, edgy, and feisty scripts.
    - Default mirror to http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu.
    - Move debootstrap.log before unlinking it to work around NFS
      brain-damage.
    - Fix typo in debootstrap(8) man page.
  * NMU with maintainer approval
  * functions/get_debs: build list of available packages from all specified
    sources; this allows debootstrap to also use e.g. custom versions of base
    packages from a source of local packages included on an installation CD.
    Closes: #398762.
