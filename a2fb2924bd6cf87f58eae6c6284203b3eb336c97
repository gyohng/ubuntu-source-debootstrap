  * scripts/gutsy: Make the fake initctl pass through "initctl version"
    calls, used by such things as invoke-rc.d to figure out whether it's
    running under Upstart (LP: #1182540).
  * scripts/sid, scripts/gutsy: Add a policy-rc.d, matching that in
    debian-installer-utils.  This is the primary way to disable daemon
    startup.
