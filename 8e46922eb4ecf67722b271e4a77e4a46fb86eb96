  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Change Priority for the udeb to extra in line with overrides file.
  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Partially revert r50134; there are people who depend on being able to
    use the "upstream" Makefile on non-Debian systems. Create necessary
    directories in the Makefile rather than relying on dh_installdirs to do
    it (LP: #172645).
  * Use ftp.us.debian.org rather than ftp.debian.org
    (http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2007/12/msg00002.html).
  [ Anthony Towns ]
  * Add minbase variant for the sid script that only install apt (and
    its dependencies) instead of all of base. (Closes: Bug#351912,
    Bug#452654)
  * Make --second-stage not bother recalculating required and base as
    it's not needed.
  * Make --arch and other arguments accept both "--arch i386" and
    "--arch=i386" forms of specifying a parameter to avoid the
    inconsistency.
  [ Stephen R. Marenka ]
  * Allow installation of etch-m68k. (Closes: Bug#458965)
  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Add minbase variant for Ubuntu gutsy/hardy; see Anthony's change above.
  * Minor manual page formatting improvements.
