  * Avoid "broken pipe" errors in bootstrap.log from the the smallyes function.
    The errors themselves are inherent to how the function is used, so just
    suppress them. Closes: #480560.
  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Do not cache Release and Release.gpg files. Closes: #488424.
  * Abort if a Packages file failed to verify.
