.SH NAME
debootstrap \- Bootstrap a basic Debian system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B debootstrap
.RB [ OPTION ]\&.\&.\&.
.I SUITE TARGET
.RI [ MIRROR
.RI [ SCRIPT ]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B debootstrap
bootstraps a basic Debian system of
.I SUITE
(eg, woody, sarge, sid) into
.I TARGET
from
.I MIRROR
by running
.IR SCRIPT .
.I MIRROR
can be an http:// URL or a file:/// URL. Notice that file:/ URLs are
translated to file:/// (correct scheme as described in RFC1738 for local filenames),
and file:// will \fBnot\fR work.
.PP
\fBDebootstrap\fR can be used to install Debian in a system without using an
installation disk but ca also be used to run a different Debian flavor in a \fBchroot\fR
environment. This way you can create a full (minimal) Debian installation which
can be used for testing purposes (see the \fBEXAMPLES\fR section). 
If you are looking for a chroot system to build packages please take a look at 
\fBpbuilder\fR.

installation may fail.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-exclude=alpha,beta\fP"
Comma separated list of packages which will be removed from download and
extract lists. WARNING: you can and probably will exclude essential packages, be
careful using this option.
.IP
.IP "\fB\-\-variant=buildd\fP"
Name of the bootstrap script variant to use.  Currently, the only variant

.PP 
To setup a \fIwoody\fR system:
.PP 
# debootstrap woody ./woody-chroot http://ftp.cx.debian.org/debian
.PP
# debootstrap woody ./woody-chroot file:///PATH_TO_LOCAL_MIRROR/debian
.PP
Full process to create a complete Debian installation of \fIsid\fR (unstable):
.PP
     main # cd / ; mkdir /sid-root
     main # debootstrap sid /sid-root http://ftp.debian.org/debian/
     [ ... watch it download the whole system ]
     main # echo "proc-sid /sid-root/proc proc none 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
     main # mount proc-sid /sid-root/proc -t proc
     main # cp /etc/hosts /sid-root/etc/hosts
     main # chroot /sid-root /bin/bash
     chroot # apt-setup 
     [ set-up /etc/apt/sources.list ]
     chroot # vi /etc/apt/sources.list 
     [ point the source to unstable ]
     chroot # dselect  
     [ you may use aptitude, install mc and vim ... ]
      main # echo "8:23:respawn:/usr/sbin/chroot /sid-root " \\
             "/sbin/getty 38400 tty8"  >> /etc/inittab
     [ define a login tty that will use this system ]
      main # init q    
     [ reload init ]
