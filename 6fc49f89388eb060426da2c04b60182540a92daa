  * Merge from Debian unstable.  Remaining changes:
    - Fix debootstrap --variant=fakechroot failure because initscripts is no
      longer part of the base system.
    - Add (Ubuntu) artful as a symlink to gutsy.
    - sync scripts/sid with scripts/gutsy
  * Drop changes merged in Debian
    - Reinstate InRelease file support to better deal with proxies where Release
      files may be cached and thus out of sync. InRelease is atomic and therefore
      not subject to failing validation because of proxy servers. (LP: #1485511)
