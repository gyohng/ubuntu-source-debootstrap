  * sid script updated:
    - Determine base dynamically (Priority: required for required packages,
      Priority: important for base packages, Build-Essential: yes for buildd
      variant base). (Closes: Bug#88984, Bug#193134)
    - Use fine grained dpkg progress display, thanks again to Colin Watson.
      (Closes: Bug#229314, Bug#231109, Bug#244563)
  * dpkg output (etc) goes to /var/log/bootstrap.log in the target, rather
    than stdout. This is probably difficult for frontends to capture
    at present.
  * Parsing of Packages file sped up. (Yay!)
  * debootstrap.deb now arch: all (Closes: Bug#122465, Bug#131552)
    - perl implementation of pkgdetails used by preference
    - devices.tar.gz reduced to minimal set of devices; frontends should
      setup udev or supply their own devices or similar in future
    - /usr/lib/debootstrap/arch not shipped
    - none of the above applies to udebs yet; though the devices.tar.gz
      change will eventually
  * Support for verifying based on Release.gpg files (--keyring). Thanks
    to Colin Watson. (Closes: Bug#313383)
  * The Gernot Heiser release, dedicated to everyone who drinks enough to
    lose their better judgement, and those of us who didn't have any in
    the first place.
  * Major update. New features:
    + Use $TARGET/debootstrap directory for state info
      (--keep-debootstrap-dir)
    + Support for cross-strapping (--foreign / --second-stage)
      (Closes: Bug#202529)
    + Support for resolving dependencies (--resolve-deps)
    + Support for Debian etch, and Ubuntu warty and hoary (Closes: Bug#312417)
    + Support for handling variants within the main suite script
    + Support for other versions of base packages in /v/c/apt/archives
    + Initial support for fine-grained dpkg progress display, thanks to
      Colin Watson (currently only for warty and hoary)
    + Initial support for determining base system dynamically.
    + No longer display "debootstrap.invalid" when working with
      Release/Packages files. (Closes: Bug#241795, Bug#256255)
    + Ignores failures for on_exit cleanup commands. (Closes: Bug#253387,
      Bug#253468, Bug#308774)
    + Early reporting of unavailable packages.
    + More efficient parsing of Packages files.
    + Generalised additions and exclusions. (Closes: Bug#191793)
    + Handles symlinked configuration files in /etc a little better.

    hppa folks. (Closes: #283752)
