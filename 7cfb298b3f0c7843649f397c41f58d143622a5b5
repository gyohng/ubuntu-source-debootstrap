  * Install base-passwd and base-files in two calls rather than one to
    avoid problems with home-built media with different ordering in
    Packages.  Thanks to Jo Shields for pointing this out and providing
    the workaround.  Closes: #601670.  LP: #1001131.

  * When deboostrapping Debian, and the debian-archive-keyring is not
    available, switch the default mirror to a https url. This way at
    least the CA level of security is available even for users who
    have no way to check gpg keys in the WoT. The https mirror is
    currently https://mirrors.kernel.org/debian.
  * Avoid writing https urls into sources.list, as apt does not support https.
